 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many elements of life can affect sexual health; thus, healthcare professionals require good knowledge of sexual medicine to encounter patients with these issues. We aimed to study final-year medical and midwifery students' self-reported knowledge of factors associated with sexuality and their knowledge of how to evaluate and treat/counsel patients with sexual problems. In addition, educational interests regarding sexual medicine were assessed.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a web-based questionnaire was distributed to final-year medical (n=233) and midwifery (n=131) students graduating between December 2018 and May 2019 in Finland.
RESULTS: Both student groups self-reported insufficient knowledge of how to consider sexuality in mentally ill patients, how to encounter victims of domestic violence/sexual abuse, and how multiculturalism affects sexuality. In addition, compared to the midwifery students, the medical students were more likely to self-report insufficient knowledge of the basics of sexual pleasure and treating the lack of it (p\textless0.001), including how to treat sexual problems due to relationship problems (p\textless0.001) or chronic diseases (p=0.015). Although several educational areas of interest arose, both student groups had two mutual most desirable educational interests: 1) reasons for dyspareunia and its treatment, n=117/233 (50.2%) for medical students, and n=60/131 (45.8%) for midwifery students; and 2) lack of sexual desire and its treatment, n=100/233 (42.9%) for medical students, and n=55/131 (42.0%) for midwifery students.
CONCLUSIONS: In both student groups, the self-reported knowledge of sexual medicine was insufficient. Thus, more education on sexual medicine should be included in the curricula of medical and midwifery education.},
